ðŸ”¹ Overview:
The Electrical Calculator is a C++ console application that helps users compute fundamental electrical parametersâ€”Voltage, Current, and Resistanceâ€”using Ohmâ€™s Law: V=IÃ—R
where:
V = Voltage (Volts)
I = Current (Amperes)
R = Resistance (Ohms)
This program provides a simple and efficient way for students, hobbyists, and engineers to perform quick electrical calculations.
ðŸ”¹ Features:
âœ… User-friendly menu system for easy navigation
âœ… Calculates Voltage, Current, and Resistance based on user input
âœ… Prevents division by zero & invalid inputs
âœ… Loop structure allows multiple calculations without restarting
âœ… Modular functions for better organization and readability

ðŸ”¹ How It Works:
The user is presented with a menu:
Compute Voltage (Requires Current & Resistance)
Compute Current (Requires Voltage & Resistance)
Compute Resistance (Requires Voltage & Current)
Exit the program
The user selects an option, provides the necessary inputs, and gets the calculated result instantly.
The program allows multiple calculations until the user chooses to exit.
========= Electrical Calculator =========
1. Compute Voltage
2. Compute Current
3. Compute Resistance
4. Exit
Select an option (1-4): 2

Enter Voltage (in Volts): 24
Enter Resistance (in Ohms): 6
Calculated Current = 4 A
 Applications:
ðŸ”¹ Useful for electronics and electrical engineering students
ðŸ”¹ Handy tool for quick circuit calculations
ðŸ”¹ Can be extended to include more electrical formulas like Power (P=VÃ—I)
